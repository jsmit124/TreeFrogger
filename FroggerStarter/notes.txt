Could not find any bugs
All functionality implemented

Cleaned and built before submission

Warnings shown are some methods hiding inherited members of BaseSprite, but when I resolve them by adding the
	'new' keyword, it removes the 'new' keyword after runtime. Do not know how to resolve these errors.
Sometimes these warnings show up, other times they do not. Weird...
